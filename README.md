# discrete-naive-bayes
built from scratch

This project shows the construction, performance testing and optimization of a discrete naive Bayes classifier that combines the discrete Bayes probability model with a decision rule. The main methods applied in the construction involve generating class conditionals and saving them in a linear space, as well as designing a decision rule based on an economic gain matrix through a userâ€™s input. The methods applied in the performance testing of the classifier involve synthetic data generation, K-fold cross validation and the optimization of the classifier is done through modification of the class conditionals based on the previous testing results.
